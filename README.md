**Notes**: See the `cfg` branch for increased functionality and configuration.


## About
I wrote this as a wrapper around a few of the classic and ecumenical vim regex commands for formatting files before I began using formatters. These commands can be found in any vim resource; they are not mine. My contribution is a basic conditional which protects the user from an error when the cursor is in the group of empty lines removed from the end of the buffer. Even with real formatters in my setup now I still like and use this because I like these specific formats to be applied to every buffer and don't want to have a formatting tool installed for them. There really isn't a reason to have this in a plugin other than wanting to disseminate this for new users and people who didn't know you could do this. You could (should) instead just yank and put the code right in your config.

- Packer
