# tidy.nvim ðŸ§¹

An [autocommand](https://neovim.io/doc/user/autocmd.html) that removes all

    - trailing whitespace
    - empty lines at the end of the buffer

on every `BufWritePre`.

## About
I originally wrote this as a wrapper around a couple of vim regex commands used for formatting files before I began using formatters. These commands are not mine, please see the `Credits` section below for sources. Even with real formatters in my setup now, I still like and use this because I like these specific formats to be applied to every buffer and don't want to have a formatting tool installed for them.


## Installation
- [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use({
    "mcauley-penney/tidy.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("tidy").setup()
    end
})
```

## Configuration
Tidy will work on all buffers using only the basic installation shown above. No configuration options are required. The options displayed below are simply examples.

```lua
require("tidy").setup({
    filetype_exclude = { "markdown", "diff" },
})
```
